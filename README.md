Each automation technique has its own folder, and within each automation folder, there are subfolders for each programming language. Within each programming language subfolder, there are subfolders for each certification. Each certification folder contains a README file that provides an overview of the certification, the courses and assignments required to obtain it, and my progress. The subfolders within each certification folder are organized by topic and contain the notes, code samples, and other resources for that topic.

This structure allows for easy navigation and organization of resources, and makes it easy to track progress for each certification and automation technique.

### What is the content on README.md file under each sub directory

provide an overview of the certification and its associated course material, as well as any relevant information for working through the course and completing the certification. Here are some elements that could be included in the README.md file:

- Course description: Provide a brief description of the course and the certification that it leads to. This should help readers understand what the certification covers and why it's important.

- Course objectives: Outline the main objectives of the course, such as the key skills or knowledge that students are expected to gain by completing the certification.

- Course requirements: List any prerequisites or requirements for taking the course, such as prior programming experience, knowledge of a specific language or tool, or access to certain software or hardware.

- Course structure: Describe the structure of the course, such as the number of modules or chapters, the types of assessments or assignments, and the estimated time required to complete the course.

- Learning outcomes: Highlight the key learning outcomes of the course, such as the ability to write automated tests for APIs or web applications, or to use codeless or visual automation tools.

- Certification details: Provide information about the certification itself, such as the name of the certifying organization, the exam format, and any other relevant details.

- Additional resources: Include links to any additional resources that might be helpful for students, such as documentation, tutorials, or forums.

- Contact information: Provide contact information for the course instructor or organization, in case students have questions or need additional support.

Overall, the README.md file should serve as a helpful guide for students who are working through the certification, providing them with the information they need to successfully complete the course and earn the certification.

### What is notes.md ?

The content of a notes.md file can vary depending on the specific project or certification being pursued, but generally it should include any notes or documentation related to the certification or course material. This could include:

- Key concepts and topics: Take notes on any key concepts or topics covered in the certification or course, along with any relevant examples or code snippets.
- Tips and tricks: Record any tips or tricks that you discover while working through the certification or course material that might be useful later.
- Errors and solutions: Note any errors you encounter during your work and how you solved them. This can be helpful if you run into the same issue later on or if you want to share your experience with others.
- Best practices: Jot down any best practices that you learn or discover while working through the certification or course material. This could include coding standards, testing strategies, or other tips for writing high-quality code.
- Resources and references: Keep a list of any resources or references that you find helpful, such as online tutorials, blog posts, or books. This can be useful for further study or research after completing the certification or course.

Overall, the goal of a notes.md file is to capture any relevant information that you want to remember or reference later on. This can help you stay organized and ensure that you are able to effectively apply what you have learned during your certification or course work.

## Conclusion

This repository will serve as a resource for anyone interested in learning test automation skills through Test Automation University. It will be updated regularly with my progress and insights, as well as any new learnings I acquire along the way. I hope that this repository will be helpful for anyone who is also pursuing these certifications or learning test automation in general.
